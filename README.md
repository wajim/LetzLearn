# Lëtz Learn - Android app
How to learn luxembourgish language by directly translating words from french, using Yandex Translator engine and open source MaryTTS engine (http://mary.dfki.de/)
The android app 'Lëtz Learn' has been developed in order to quickly learn Luxembourgish language from scratch, by directly translating words from a native well known language into this complicated language. A lot of methods exist to learn a new language but according to my personal experience this is another way to do that. Lëtz stands for Luxembourg (Luxembourgish country name), so Lëtz Learn is aka Let's Learn!
Memorizing new language words is fun but there is still a problem: how are they pronounced? That is where we need a TTS engine to hear a native luxembourgish voice, a robot or a synthesis machine in order to match phonetic of words and how to use them. This is quite complicated as the language is not so spoken by lot of people as french or english. Therefore don't look in popular vocal assistants
like Google(assistant), Amazon(Alexa), Apple(Siri) for luxembourgish translation...Chance is a team in Saarland University (Germany) has recorded a female voice of luxembourgish vocabulary and implemented that in a TTS engine -> MaryTTS, info here:  http://mary.dfki.de/
That is what is used in this app for pronounciation learning.
